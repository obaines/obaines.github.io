Teaching Associate position at the University of Nottingham, School of Geography for the Emerging Challenges in Biogeography 3rd year undergraduate module. As part of this, my duties included supporting computer-based practicals and fortnightly debates around a variety of topics including conservation, intraspecific variation, acclimation and carbon sequestration. Furthermore, I was in charge of creating and delivering hour-long tutorials complementing topics that had been covered in lectures and practicals, normally in the format of paper discussions in small groups. These again were based around a variety of ecological topics including IUCN Red Listing, and whether protecting forests for carbon also protects biodiversity.
