I acted as a demonstrator for the 2nd year undergraduate module 'Digital Explorers' at the School of Geography, University of Nottingham. I was on hand to aid students with computer-based practical concerning key GIS topics including raster/vector manipulation, flow analyses and data visualisation using ArcMap. I additionally provided support for individual GIS project, investigating a topic in either physical or human geography using spatial data.
