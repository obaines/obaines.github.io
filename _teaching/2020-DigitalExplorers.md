I acted as a demonstrator for the 2nd year undergraduate module 'Digital Explorers' at the School of Geography, University of Nottingham. As part of this, I helped students through computer laboratory practicals around various GIS topics (e.g. raster/vector manipulation, flow analyses) using ArcMap and provided support for individual GIS projects investing a topic in either physical or human geography using spatial data.
