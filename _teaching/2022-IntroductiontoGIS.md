Teaching Associate on the Introduction to GIS course for first year undergraduates in Geography at the University of Nottingham. This course taught students about data types  and spatial analysis using ArcGIS online, and culminated in an interactive map and report about the benefits of using ArcGIS online. I graded submissions, and provided detailed feedback.
